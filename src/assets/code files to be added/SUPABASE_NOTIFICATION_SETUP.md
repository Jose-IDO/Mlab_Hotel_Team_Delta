# Supabase Notification System Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will walk you through setting up the notification system database tables in Supabase. The notification system allows users to receive real-time notifications for booking confirmations, booking updates, and promotional messages.

---

## Prerequisites
- ✅ Supabase database is created and accessible
- ✅ Railway backend is deployed and connected to Supabase
- ✅ Database connection pooler is configured (to avoid IPv6 issues)

---

## PART 1: Run Database Migrations

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. **Navigate to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com
   - Make sure you're logged in (if not, click "Log In" in the top right corner)

2. **Select Your Project:**
   - On the Supabase dashboard homepage, you'll see a list of your projects
   - Click on your project: `delta-hotel-db` (or your project name)

3. **Open SQL Editor:**
   - In the left sidebar, look for **"SQL Editor"** (it has a code/file icon)
   - Click on **"SQL Editor"**
   - The SQL Editor will open in the main panel

4. **Create a New Query:**
   - In the SQL Editor, look for a button labeled **"New query"** (usually at the top)
   - Click **"New query"**
   - A blank query editor will appear

---

### Step 2: Run Migration 1 - Add Type Column

1. **Open the Migration File:**
   - In your local project, navigate to: `server/src/sql/`
   - Open the file: `012_add_notification_type.sql`
   - Select all the contents (Ctrl+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C)

2. **Paste into Supabase SQL Editor:**
   - Go back to Supabase SQL Editor (in your browser)
   - Click in the query editor area
   - Paste the SQL code (Ctrl+V)
   - You should see SQL code that starts with:
     ```sql
     -- Add type column to notifications table for categorizing notifications
     DO $$
     BEGIN
     ...
     ```

3. **Run the Migration:**
   - Look for a **"Run"** button (usually at the bottom right of the editor, or press Ctrl+Enter)
   - Click **"Run"** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
   - Wait for the query to execute (usually takes 1-2 seconds)

4. **Verify Success:**
   - You should see a success message in the results panel
   - Look for: `✅ Added type column to notifications table` or similar
   - If you see an error, check the error message and try again

---

### Step 3: Run Migration 2 - Fix UUID Types (REQUIRED)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This migration will delete all existing notifications because it changes column types from INT to UUID. This is expected and necessary.

1. **Create a New Query:**
   - In Supabase SQL Editor, click **"New query"** again
   - This creates a fresh query editor

2. **Open the Migration File:**
   - In your local project, navigate to: `server/src/sql/`
   - Open the file: `013_fix_notification_uuid_types.sql`
   - Select all the contents (Ctrl+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C)

3. **Paste into Supabase SQL Editor:**
   - Go back to Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click in the new query editor area
   - Paste the SQL code (Ctrl+V)
   - You should see SQL code that starts with:
     ```sql
     -- Fix notifications table to use UUID types for user_id and booking_id
     ...
     ```

4. **Review the Migration:**
   - This migration will:
     - Drop foreign key constraints
     - **Delete all existing notifications** (TRUNCATE TABLE)
     - Change `user_id` from INT to UUID
     - Change `booking_id` from INT to UUID
     - Re-add foreign key constraints

5. **Run the Migration:**
   - Click **"Run"** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
   - Wait for the query to execute (usually takes 1-2 seconds)

6. **Verify Success:**
   - You should see a success message: `✅ Notifications table updated to use UUID types!`
   - If you see an error, check the error message

---

## PART 2: Verify Tables Were Created/Updated

### Step 4: Check Notifications Table

1. **Open Table Editor:**
   - In Supabase Dashboard, look at the left sidebar
   - Click on **"Table Editor"** (it has a table/grid icon)
   - The Table Editor will open showing all your tables

2. **Find the Notifications Table:**
   - Scroll through the list of tables
   - Look for a table named **"notifications"**
   - Click on it to open the table view

3. **Verify Table Structure:**
   - The table should have these columns:
     - `id` - Type: `int4` or `serial` (Primary Key)
     - `user_id` - Type: `uuid` ✅ (Must be UUID, not int4)
     - `message` - Type: `text`
     - `booking_id` - Type: `uuid` ✅ (Must be UUID, not int4, can be NULL)
     - `type` - Type: `varchar` or `text` ✅ (Should exist)
     - `read` - Type: `bool` or `boolean`
     - `created_at` - Type: `timestamp`

4. **Check Column Types:**
   - **Critical:** `user_id` and `booking_id` must be `uuid` type
   - If they show as `int4` or `integer`, the migration didn't work correctly
   - If `type` column is missing, Migration 1 didn't run correctly

---

## PART 3: Test the Notification System

### Step 5: Test Backend API Endpoint

1. **Test Notifications Endpoint:**
   - Open a new browser tab
   - Go to: `https://mlabhotelteamdelta-production.up.railway.app/notifications`
   - You should see a JSON response (may be empty array `[]` if no notifications exist)
   - If you see `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}`, check the error message

2. **Expected Response:**
   ```json
   {"ok": true, "data": []}
   ```
   - Empty array is fine - it means no notifications yet, but the endpoint works

3. **If You Get 401 Error:**
   - This is expected - the endpoint requires authentication
   - The endpoint is working correctly, it just needs a logged-in user

---

### Step 6: Test in Your Application

1. **Start Your Frontend:**
   - In your terminal, make sure you're in the project root
   - Run: `npm run dev`
   - Wait for the dev server to start

2. **Log In as a User:**
   - Open your app in browser: `http://localhost:5173` (or your dev URL)
   - Log in with a user account
   - You should see the notification bell icon in the navbar

3. **Create a Test Booking:**
   - Navigate to hotel details or booking page
   - Create a test booking
   - After booking is created, check the notification bell
   - You should see a notification badge with "1" or similar
   - Click the bell to see the booking confirmation notification

4. **Test Admin Promotions:**
   - Log in as an admin user
   - Go to Admin Dashboard
   - Look for "Send Promotions" in the sidebar
   - Click on it
   - Enter a test message
   - Click "Send to All Users"
   - Check if users receive the promotion notification

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Migration fails with "column already exists"
**Solution:**
- The `type` column might already exist
- Check the Table Editor to see if the column exists
- If it exists, you can skip Migration 1
- If you want to re-run it, you can modify the SQL to use `IF NOT EXISTS` (which the migration already does)

### Problem: Migration fails with "cannot cast type integer to uuid"
**Solution:**
- This means there's existing data in the notifications table
- Migration 2 should handle this by truncating the table first
- Make sure you're running Migration 2 (013_fix_notification_uuid_types.sql), not Migration 1
- If the error persists, manually delete all rows: `DELETE FROM notifications;` then re-run Migration 2

### Problem: Notifications not appearing in frontend
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify user is authenticated (`hotel_token` in localStorage)
3. Check Network tab - look for requests to `/notifications` endpoint
4. Verify the endpoint returns data: Test `https://mlabhotelteamdelta-production.up.railway.app/notifications` with authentication
5. Check Railway logs for backend errors

### Problem: "relation 'notifications' does not exist"
**Solution:**
- The notifications table doesn't exist yet
- Check if you ran the initial migrations (from `001_init.sql`)
- The notifications table should be created in `001_init.sql`
- If it doesn't exist, you may need to create it manually or run all migrations from the beginning

### Problem: Foreign key constraint errors
**Solution:**
- This usually means `user_id` or `booking_id` values don't match existing users/bookings
- Make sure the `users` and `bookings` tables exist and have UUID primary keys
- Verify the foreign key constraints are set up correctly in Migration 2
